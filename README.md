# The Ploopy Pick-And-Place Feeder

By some stroke of luck, you've made your way here. The Ploopy Pick-And-Place Feeder. Your life will never be the same.

This repository contains all of the design and production files necessary to make a Ploopy Pick-And-Place automated feeder, as well as its mating base plate. We've also included some kick-ass documentation in the Wiki on how to get it made and assemble it.

These feeders have been designed for use with standard 8mm tapes, as outlined in EIA-481.

Check out a video of it in operation in a LitePlacer open-source pick-and-place machine [right here](https://youtube.com) **TODO: add video**.

What are you waiting for? Your new life awaits.
